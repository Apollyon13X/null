z340: Fraud Escalation and Reporting
Overview

The z340 protocol is the emergency response system of the v01d. It manages fraud escalation and system-wide shutdown procedures in the event of a critical security breach or verified high-impact scam.
Critical Warning

⚠️ WARNING: Activation of z340 emergency shutdown commands will terminate all active sessions and potentially lock the system. Use only in verified crisis scenarios.

Fraud Escalation Workflow 

    Detection: null or Death_Agent flags a critical threat. 
    Verification: Multi-sig verification or high-confidence AI scoring. 
    Escalation:
         Local: User notified immediately.
         Network: (If configured) Broadcasts alert to other v01d nodes.
          
    Action:
         Submission of malicious address to the Graveyard.
         Freezing of related assets (if governed by DAO).
          

Integration with $DEATH Token 

     Governance: High-tier $DEATH holders (Tier 2/Hidden) can propose a z340 escalation vote.
     Impact: Activation may affect liquidity pools if a token within the pool is flagged as a critical threat.
     

Post-Execution 

After a z340 event, the system enters "Safe Mode". Data recovery is handled via IPFS backups of the CHAOS Document.
