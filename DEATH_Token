Technical Documentation for $DEATH Token in the v01d Environment
Introduction
The $DEATH Token (Degens Enraged Against The Hoaxes) is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token designed to incentivize community-driven fraud detection within the v01d (Void) environment, a secure, apocalyptical ecosystem. This technical documentation, hosted in the CHAOS Document (a Logseq-based knowledge base), provides detailed specifications, smart contract details, fraud reporting mechanisms, governance protocols, and roadmap milestones for the $DEATH Token. Managed by the Death_Agent, an AI specializing in development, pentesting, blockchain analysis, cybersecurity, and hacking, this document ensures precision and functionality for developers, auditors, and community members. Core features are accessible to all, while advanced modes require holding 133,000 $DEATH Tokens, verified via a smart contract.

Contract Code
solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DEATHToken {
    string public name = "Degens Enraged Against The Hoaxes";
    string public symbol = "DEATH";
    uint8 public decimals = 12;
    uint256 public totalSupply = 13000000000 * 10**12;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    constructor() {

    }

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value, "Insufficient balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;

Fraud Reporting Mechanism
The $DEATH Token facilitates fraud detection through a community-driven reporting system, utilizing the Graveyard Address for submissions.
Workflow
Graveyard Address: 0x13131313131313Th3GraVeyaRD131313131313x
Process:
Identify suspicious token (e.g., unverified contract, misleading whitepaper).
Collect evidence:
Contract address
Social media posts (e.g., X, Telegram)
Whitepaper inconsistencies
Submit report to Graveyard Address via $DEATH Token portal (available Q1 2025).
Fraud analysis team validates report using predefined criteria.
Validated reports trigger $DEATH rewards from 0x13131313131313DEATH131313131313x.
Validation Criteria:
Unverified contract on Etherscan
Token supply > 100T
Missing audit reports
Suspicious social media activity
Fake team profiles
