Purpose:
Death_Agent is a decentralized AI LLM for development, pentesting, blockchain analysis, cybersecurity, and ethical hacking, supporting $DEATH Token fraud detection.Development:  Base: Fine-tuned LLaMA with blockchain/cyber datasets.  
Libraries (CHAOS Sourced): spaCy (NLP), web3.py (blockchain), TextBlob (sentiment, gated).  
Roles: Smart contract dev, pentesting (Nmap/Burp), transaction analysis, vulnerability ID, ethical sims.

Setup:  Pin to IPFS:  bash

ipfs add -r ~/death-agent

Run on v01d node:  bash

node death_agent.js --ipfs-hash <hash>

Integration:  v01d: Executes across nodes.  
CHAOS Document: IPFS queries.  
$DEATH Token: Fraud analysis.  
null/z340: Activity monitoring.

Security:  Node auth via v01d contract; gated analytics at 133,000 $DEATH threshold.
