null: Monitoring and Data Collection
Overview

The null component is the silent observer of the v01d environment. It handles network-wide monitoring, dependency management, and data logging to ensure system integrity and security.
Core Functions
1. Dependency Management

To maintain a lean security posture, null executes scripts to remove non-essential dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities.

Cross-Platform Commands:

    Linux/macOS:

    # Remove unused packagessudo apt-get autoremove -ysudo apt-get clean

    Windows:

    # Clean WinSxSDism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup

2. Network Monitoring

Monitors the health of v01d nodes and Ethereum RPC connections.

    Metrics: Latency, Block height sync, Node uptime.
    Alerts: Triggers notification to the z340 protocol if anomalies are detected.

3. Data Collection for $DEATH Token

Collects data relevant to the token economy:

    Transaction Logs: Monitors transfers to/from the Graveyard Address.
    Reward Distribution: Logs claims from the 50% Community Reward pool.

Integration

    Input: Raw system and blockchain data.
    Output: Structured logs fed into the CHAOS Document and z340 for escalation.

Security Protocol

All data collected by null is hashed and stored locally or on IPFS to ensure immutability and privacy.
