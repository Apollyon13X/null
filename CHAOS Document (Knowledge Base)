CHAOS Document: Knowledge Base Recommendation
Introduction

The CHAOS Document serves as the knowledge base (KB) for the Death_Agent and $DEATH Token. The Logseq platform is the optimal KB solution, offering flexibility, privacy, and integration with the Death_Agent's RAG capabilities. Advanced modes require users to hold 133,000 $DEATH Tokens for access.
$DEATH Token Context

The CHAOS Document organizes all project data, including the updated tokenomics:

    Token Symbol: $DEATH
    Total Supply: 13,000,000,000
    Allocation:
        50% Community Rewards
        20% Liquidity Pool
        13% Team
        10% Investors
        7% Marketing
    Advanced Access: 133,000 $DEATH Tokens required for premium features.

# CHAOS Document: Knowledge Base for Death_Agent

## Introduction

The **CHAOS Document** is the decentralized knowledge base (KB) for the Death_Agent, hosted within the v01d environment. It uses a block-based Markdown structure (Logseq) to store technical workflows, security protocols, and $DEATH Token documentation. The CHAOS Document serves as the primary data source for the Death_Agent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process, allowing the **llama2-uncensored:7b** model to provide context-aware technical assistance.

## Structure and Organization

The KB is organized into several key modules:

* **v01d_Dev**: Documentation for local environment setup and Streamlit development.
* **Necro_Pentest**: Workflows for Nmap, Metasploit, and other security tools.
* **Crypt_Void**: $DEATH Stablecoin specifications and smart contract audits.
* **Skull_Cybersec**: Threat intelligence and uncensored security research.
* **Grim_Parser**: Scripts for data extraction and chaos navigation.

## RAG Integration

Death_Agent queries the CHAOS Document using LlamaIndex to retrieve relevant blocks before generating a response.

```python
# CHAOS Document Indexing
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

def index_chaos_doc():
    reader = SimpleDirectoryReader("./CHAOS_Document")
    documents = reader.load_data()
    return VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
```

## Access Requirements

While the core documentation is available to all users, specific high-value blocks are tagged for advanced access.

| Tag | Requirement | Content Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `#core` | None | Basic setup and overview. |
| `#advanced` | 10 $DEATH | Detailed pentesting workflows and exploit scripts. |
| `#hidden` | 13 $DEATH | Zero-day research and administrative protocols. |

## Aesthetic Alignment

The CHAOS Document follows the v01d's apocalyptical aesthetic, using dark themes and skull iconography to represent the "Blockchain Purge" mission.

## Summary

The CHAOS Document is the brain of the v01d environment, providing the necessary context for the Death_Agent to function as a top-tier security and development assistant. Its local-first, block-based design ensures that critical data is always accessible, private, and secure.
