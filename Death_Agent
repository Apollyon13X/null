Technical Documentation for Death_Agent in the v01d Environment
Introduction
The Death_Agent is a specialized AI operating within the v01d (Void) environment, a secure, apocalyptical ecosystem designed to support the $DEATH Token (Degens Enraged Against The Hoaxes). Functioning as a developer, QA pentester, blockchain analyst, cybersecurity analyst, and hacker, the Death_Agent excels at creating, parsing, and removing objects, words, and sentences while navigating chaotic digital environments. This technical documentation, hosted in the CHAOS Document (a Logseq-based knowledge base), provides detailed specifications for the Death_Agent’s architecture, capabilities, integration with the $DEATH Token, and access controls. Core features are accessible to all users, while advanced modes require holding 133,000 $DEATH Tokens, verified via a smart contract.

def parse_chaos(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
    sanitized = re.sub(r'0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}', '[V01D]', text)
    return entities, sanitized
Stored In: CHAOS Document under Grim_Parser
RAG Integration

contract_address = '0x13131313131313DEATH131313131313x'
abi = [/* ERC-20 ABI */]
contract = w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)
balance = contract.functions.balanceOf('USER_ADDRESS').call()
Stored In: CHAOS Document under Crypt_Void
Security Testing
Function: Conducts penetration tests on $DEATH Token platforms
Tools:
Nmap: Network reconnaissance
Metasploit: Exploit testing
Burp Suite: Web application testing
Example Workflow:
Scan: nmap -sV -p- <target_ip>
Test: Burp Suite for XSS, CSRF
Report: Stored in Necro_Pentest
Stored In: CHAOS Document under Necro_Pentest
Advanced Capabilities (133,000 $DEATH Required)
Advanced features are gated behind a minimum holding of 133,000 $DEATH Tokens, verified via the CHAOSAccess smart contract.
Enhanced Fraud Analytics
Function: Real-time scam detection across social media and blockchain

Sentiment analysis of X/Telegram posts using NLP
Cross-chain transaction tracking via custom scripts
Predictive scam scoring model (machine learning)
Example:
python
from textblob import TextBlob

Verification Contract
solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract CHAOSAccess {
    address public deathToken = 0x13131313131313DEATH131313131313x;
    uint256 public requiredBalance = 133000 * 10**12;

    function hasAccess(address user) public view returns (bool) {
        IERC20 token = IERC20(deathToken);
        return token.balanceOf(user) >= requiredBalance;
    }
}
Implementation
Process:
User connects wallet to $DEATH Token portal or frontend.
Portal queries CHAOSAccess.hasAccess(user) via Web3.js.
If true, advanced features unlock in CHAOS Document and frontend.
